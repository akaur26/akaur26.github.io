Variables are like a label or a box that has a value. The value is assigned to a variable. The value can be a name, a number or phrase. The method can print a value multiple times saving time and making it easier to print the value if I need to multiple times. By creating a method I won't need to type "puts name" 12 times which would be very annnoying and time consuming. They can be a way of life because they are what we humans are always trying to create which is making things quick and easy to complete tasks. This would help complete projects more efficiently plus there will be less room for errors such as writing "puts name" 11 times instead of 12.
