I chose to do software engeneering because my friend Teinelle and I want to start a business online. So we thought why not do software engineering and have complete control over how we want our website to look and function. This way we can save time and money doing it ourselves instead of hiring someone. I was a little interested in coding because my brother knew coding a bit but he would not teach me. Then in college senior year Teinelle told me about the business idea and I liked it and joined her on the new venture. Thats when I found out that Teinelle knows coding and she taught me the little bit she knew. Plus everything is online now so I think having software engineering skills is extremly beneficial and necessary.
